# Utopian-Tree--Algo

This C# program solves the "Utopian Tree" problem, where a tree grows in cycles doubling in height during spring (odd cycles) and increasing by 1 meter during summer. Starting at a height of 1 meter, the program simulates 'n' growth cycles using a loop, alternating between multiplying the height by 2 and adding 1 based on whether the cycle is odd or even. The final height after n cycles is returned. The main method handles multiple test cases by reading the number of cycles for each, calling the "utopianTree" function, and writing the result to the output stream. This approach efficiently simulates the seasonal growth pattern for each test case.
